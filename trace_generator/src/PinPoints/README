Download the right PinPoints kit for your platform + compiler.

* Building PinPoints tools:
    %cd <your_pin-kit_location>/PinPoints
    % make
Assuming you have the right kit + compiler, this will create isimpoint, controller, branch_predictor,  and bbtrace and copy them to the 'bin' sub-directory.

* Building Simpoint tool:
Obtain the latest (3.*) SimPoint tool from UCSD 
[ http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/ ], build the 'simpoint' binary
for your platform and copy it to the 'bin' sub-directory.
    
* Generating PinPoints for your application:
Start with the script 'runpinpoints.template.sh'; change various variables 
as suggested by CHANGEME in the script.

Parameters you must set:

PATH : Make sure 'simpoint' and 'pin' are in your PATH 
        Add the directories (from a pin kit) PinPoints and PinPoints/bin to 
         your PATH.
WORKDIR : to point to your work-directory.

PROGRAM and INPUT : Only used to name your PinPoints files.

COMMAND : The actual command to run your application.

Parameters you can set:

SLICE_SIZE, MAXK, CUTOFF

The modified script, will run your base.exe natively,
under 'isimpoint' to generate basic block profile, run "simpoint" to generate 
a PinPoints file, and check that the PinPoints can be reached using 
'controller'.

How to use PinPoints generated with your Pintool?
------------------------------------------------
You need to base your  your simulator/trace-generator pintool on 
'PinPoints/controller.cpp' and run it in a similar manner with "-ppfile".
